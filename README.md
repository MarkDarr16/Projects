# Projects


The password management system was a class project. My contribution was the GUI, password policy, and encyrption. For the survey paper, a classmate and myself contributed the description of the architecture. Additionally, The PMS.jar file is a standalone program. Your machine may flag the file as a potential virus because we are unknown developers. However, I assure you that the program is safe. ENJOY
